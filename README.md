# Weekly Challenge #35 - Baseball Reflex

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that tests the reflexes of the user.** As I was watching a baseball game, I was really impressed by how little time there was for the batter to swing before the time the ball leaves the hand of the pitcher. Your goal for this challenge is to test user's reflexes in a virtual setting!
